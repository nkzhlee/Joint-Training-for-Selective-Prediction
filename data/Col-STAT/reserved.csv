R_1l3OgnUojK96LJf_q4_a,No because many factors can go into why one fisherman caught bigger fish than the other such as location of the larger fish at the time of the trip.,q4_a,,,1,,1,1,0,1,0,1
R_1l3OgnUojK96LJf_q3_b,"To decide whether or not to keep the order, the engineer should check each of the display screens and make sure they are in working order and could the ones that are not.

R_1l3OgnUojK96LJf_q3_a,No because the orders are all independent of each other. If the last order had more than 5% that has nothing to do with the next order being good or not.,q3_a,,,1,,1,1,0,1,0,1
R_1l3OgnUojK96LJf_q2_b,If Carla has a higher score than the average mean then she would be considered as having a good ear for music.,q2_b,,,1,,1,1,0,1,0,1
R_1l3OgnUojK96LJf_q2_a,In order to determine the percent of the notes that Carla could correctly identify. You should use statistical significance to see how she compares to the average person.,q2_a,,,2,,1,1,0,1,0,2

R_1Kxv1joisWwlZ51_q2_b,"I would sample all notes separately and ask students to identify each note, rather than a single note. This would eliminate the ""luck"" factor of simply using a single note.",q2_b,1,,,,1,1,0,1,0,1

R_1kNWJw8G1sE8kB9_q3_a,"Here, it only seems matter of simple calculations. If more of 5% of the stock is damaged, the company will reject the order, if less than 5% is damaged, the company will accept the order. There's nothing to infer, only the calculation of how many pieces out of 150 parts constitute the 5% is to be done.",q3_a,,2,,,1,1,0,1,0,2
R_1kNWJw8G1sE8kB9_q2_b,"Even if not optimal, we can determine a standard level of probability for an individual to guess the right note. From this, it is possible to generate random repetition of  the test based on the probability. It is possible to compare Carla's score to the random generated ones, to see how good does she score at the test, determining a P-value of 0.5 However, this method is biased since we decide in the first place which proportion of guessing constitues a good hearing.",q2_b,,2,,,1,1,0,1,0,2

R_1Kkgt0EsZm07Plp_q4_a,Yes it should be used to determine if Mark or Dan is better by testing to see who can catch more fish over a long period of time. This experiment needs to be long-run.,q4_a,,,1,,1,1,0,1,0,1
R_1Kkgt0EsZm07Plp_q3_b,I would decide whether the electronics comapany should accept it by seeing that more than 5% of the screens are bad,q3_b,,,2,,1,1,0,1,0,2
R_1Kkgt0EsZm07Plp_q3_a,Yes it should be used because the number of bad models would give the purchaser a good idea in to whether buy the bulk order or not.,q3_a,,,1,,1,1,0,1,0,1

R_1Kk96riJ6lNQMLj_q4_b,I would put the data into Excel and have it calculate the averages/means. I would then use the t-distribution and compare the p-value to determine significance,q4_b,2,,,,1,1,0,1,0,2

I would also test people who admit to having a bad ear for music to see and observe both ends of the spectrum.
